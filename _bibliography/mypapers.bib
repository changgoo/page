     abstract = "{\{CO\}(J=1\{--\}0) line emission is a widely used observational tracer
        of molecular gas, rendering essential the X $_{CO}$ factor,
        which is applied to convert CO luminosity to \{\{\{H\}\}\}$_{2}$
        mass. We use numerical simulations to study how X $_{CO}$
        depends on numerical resolution, non-steady-state chemistry,
        physical environment, and observational beam size. Our study
        employs 3D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of galactic
        disks with solar neighborhood conditions, where star formation
        and the three-phase interstellar medium (ISM) are self-
        consistently regulated by gravity and stellar feedback.
        Synthetic CO maps are obtained by postprocessing the MHD
        simulations with chemistry and radiation transfer. We find that
        CO is only an approximate tracer of \{\{\{H\}\}\}$_{2}$. On
        parsec scales, W $_{CO}$ is more fundamentally a measure of
        mass-weighted volume density, rather than \{\{\{H\}\}\}$_{2}$
        column density. Nevertheless, < \{X\}$_{\{\{CO}$\}\} >
        =(0.7\{\textbackslashtextstyle \{--\}\}1.0){\texttimes}
        \{10\}$^{20}$ \{\{\{cm\}\}\}$^{-2}$ \{\{\{K\}\}\}$^{-1}$
        \{\{\{km\}\}\}$^{-1}$ \{\{s\}\}, which is consistent with
        observations and insensitive to the evolutionary ISM state or
        radiation field strength if steady-state chemistry is assumed.
        Due to non-steady-state chemistry, younger molecular clouds have
        slightly lower < \{X\}$_{CO}$\}> and flatter profiles of X
        $_{CO}$ versus extinction than older ones. The \{CO\}-dark
        \{\{\{H\}\}\}$_{2}$ fraction is 26\%-79\%, anticorrelated with
        the average extinction. As the observational beam size increases
        from 1 to 100 pc, < \{X\}$_{CO}$\}> increases by a factor of
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}2. Under solar neighborhood conditions, <
        \{X\}$_{CO}$\}> in molecular clouds is converged at a numerical
        resolution of 2 pc. However, the total CO abundance and
        luminosity are not converged even at the numerical resolution of
        1 pc. Our simulations successfully reproduce the observed
        variations of X $_{CO}$ on parsec scales, as well as the
        dependence of X $_{CO}$ on extinction and the CO excitation
        temperature.}",

 abstract = {{We present high-resolution Very Large Array (VLA) continuum observations
at S-band ($3$ GHz, $560$ pc scale) and X-band ($10$ GHz, $200$
pc scale) of the ram-pressure-stripped Virgo galaxy NGC 4522, to
investigate the characteristics of its radio continuum, spectral
index, and magnetic field under the influence of the
intracluster medium (ICM). The total radio continuum shows an
asymmetry that extends northwest, mirroring the HI gas
distribution, but showing distinct features in the extraplanar
regions. The spectral index steepens systematically from
$α\sim-0.6$ in the main disk to $α\sim-1.1$ in the outer disk.
We find that the spectral index behavior of the outer disk is
mainly due to an ICM shock that can re-accelerate electrons and
a significant reduction of thermal emission. Intriguingly,
extraplanar clouds exhibit exceptionally flat spectral indices
($α\sim-0.2$ to $0$), resulting from a combination of
significantly enhanced thermal emission and pronounced spectral
aging of the non-thermal component. Although some of these
regions correlate with H$α$, others do not. We propose that the
mixing between the ICM and interstellar medium (ISM) is an
alternative mechanism that enhances thermal emission
independently of star formation. Polarized continuum emissions
are highly asymmetric, preferentially distributed along the ICM
wind side, and the polarization fraction increases radially
outward from the galactic midplane, indicating that the
polarized emission is strongly influenced by the ICM wind. Our
results show how and where the ICM substantially affects the
ISM, and also demonstrate that high-frequency observations are
crucial for analyzing the radio continuum of ram pressure
stripping galaxies.}},

the cloud-scale baryon cycle, we perform a high-resolution study
of the CNM in and around the extreme star-forming region 30
Doradus (30 Dor). For our study, we use Galactic Australian
Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder H I Survey data and produce H
I emission and absorption cubes on 7 pc scales. To examine the
CNM structures toward 30 Dor, we decompose the H I absorption
cube into 862 Gaussian components and find that these components
are distributed at four velocity ranges (B1, B2, B3, and B4,
respectively): 200─230 km s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$, 230─260 km
s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$, 260─277 km s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$, and
277─300 km s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$. We derive line-of-sight
average spin temperatures and opacity-corrected total H I column
densities and show that the B1─B4 structures have systematically
different properties, indicating that they are physically
distinct. As for the nature of the observed CNM structures, we
find that B2 is associated with the main dense structure where
ionized, atomic, and molecular gases are concentrated. B3 and B4
trace inflows whose combined mass flux rate of 0.14

comparable to the current star formation rate, while B1 probes
outflows with a much lower mass flux rate of 0.007

Interestingly, the H I column densities in B1─B4 are nearly
uniform with a factor of 2 spatial variations, implying the

 abstract = {{Modern high-resolution simulations of the interstellar medium (ISM) have
shown that key factors in governing star formation are the
competing influences of radiative dissipation, pressure support
driven by stellar feedback, and gravity. However, cosmological
simulations of galaxy formation are unable to resolve this
physics in detail and therefore rely on approximate treatments,
often taking the form of empirical subgrid models of the ISM
expressed in terms of an effective equation of state (EOS). Here
we seek to improve these heuristic models by directly fitting to
results of the high-resolution TIGRESS simulations, which have
shown that the dynamical equilibrium of the ISM can be
understood in terms of a pressure-regulated feedback-modulated
(PRFM) model for star formation. We explore a simple subgrid
model that draws on the PRFM concept but uses only local
quantities. It accurately reproduces the TIGRESS scalings for
pure gas discs, but predicts slightly less star formation in the
presence of an additional stellar disc. We compare this to the
older Springel \& Hernquist and TNG prescriptions by applying
all three models to isolated simulations of disc galaxies as
well as to a set of high-resolution zoom-in simulations carried
out with a novel 'multizoom' technique that we introduce here.
The softer TIGRESS EOS produces substantially thinner disc
galaxies, which has important ramifications for disc stability
and galaxy morphology. The stellar mass of galaxies is hardly
modified at low redshift, reflecting the dominating influence of
large-scale gaseous inflows and outflows, which are not
sensitive to the EOS itself.}},

low-metallicity (0.27 solar metallicity) dwarf galaxy. As a low-
metallicity starburst, IC10's interstellar medium conditions
could reflect small-scale physical conditions that mirror those
of early galaxies, providing a unique window into the heating
and cooling processes that shaped the interstellar medium in
early-Universe environments. Leveraging the high angular (<5''
\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 15pc) and spectral (0.4 km/s)
resolution of the Local Group L-band Survey, we searched for HI
absorption against nine continuum radio sources and detected
absorption along three sightlines corresponding to internal
radio emission sources within IC10. Using Gaussian decomposition
and radiative transfer, we characterize the CNM, deriving spin
temperatures of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde30-55 K, column
densities of (0.6-3.0)x 1$0^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, cold HI fractions
of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 21-37\%, and line widths of
\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 5.6-13.6 km/s. For each
individual detection of HI absorption, we find corresponding
molecular emission from 12CO (J=1-0), HCO+ (J=1-0), and HCN
(J=1-0) at similar velocities and with comparable linewidths,
indicating a well-mixed cold atomic and molecular medium. In
IC10, the CNM shows a clear kinematic connection to the high-
density ISM, implying a stronger dynamical coupling with
molecular gas than in the Milky Way, in line with expectations
for low-metallicity environments. At the
\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 15 pc scales probed by slightly
extended HII regions in IC10, unresolved CNM clouds likely
contribute to line blending, so the observed broad HI linewidths
may partly reflect spatial and kinematic averaging.}},

sample a wide range of gas surface densities, gravitational
potentials, and star formation rates (SFRs), and include a
spiral arm simulation. Our approach incorporates CR advection by
the background gas, streaming along the magnetic field limited
by the local ion Alfv{\'e}n speed, and diffusion relative to the
Alfv{\'e}n wave frame, with the diffusion coefficient set by the
balance between streaming-driven Alfv{\'e}n wave excitation and
damping mediated by local gas properties. We find that dynamical
transport mechanisms (streaming and advection) are almost solely
responsible for GeV CR transport in the extraplanar regions of
galaxies, while diffusion along the magnetic field dominates
within the primarily neutral ISM of galactic disks. We develop a
simple 1D predictive model for the CR pressure P$_{c}$,
dependent only on injected CR flux and gas parameters. We
demonstrate that the CR transport efficiency increases with
increasing SFR, and provide a fit for the CR feedback yield

Mpc) box, we perform a set of numerical experiments that
systematically vary the mass and energy loadings of such winds,
finding that their energy content is the key parameter
controlling the stellar to dark matter mass ratio. Increasing
the mass loading, at fixed energy, actually results in mildly
enhanced star formation, counter to prevailing wisdom, due to
the wind becoming cooler. Of the simple parametrizations that we
test, we find that an energy loading that scales inversely with
halo mass best matches a wide range of observations and can do
so with mass loadings drastically lower than those in most
previous cosmological simulations. In this scenario, much less
material is ejected from the interstellar medium. Instead, winds
both heat gas in the circumgalactic medium, slowing infall onto
the galaxy, and also drive shocks beyond the virial radius,
decreasing the halo-scale accretion rate. We can also report
that a much lower fraction of the available supernova energy is
needed in preventative galaxy regulation than required by

that the mass, energy, and metal loading factors are only weakly
affected by the inclusion of a metal diffusion model. The metal
enrichment factor at low altitudes above the galactic disk is
higher by around 20\% when the metal diffusion model is
included. Specifically, we find more efficient cooling in the
cold interstellar medium, due to more efficient metal mixing
that leads to shorter cooling times of the warm gas, which
becomes available more quickly for star formation. The most
striking effect of the metal diffusion model is that, without
metal diffusion, there is more rapid cooling in the hot phase
and a reduced sound speed by a factor of 2. Specifically, we
find that the hot phase is more metal enriched in the case
without metal diffusion leading to more rapid overcooling of
that phase, which is consistent with the higher sound speed we
find in the runs with metal diffusion.}},

continuously loses energy after shocks toward the cold clouds

 abstract = {{We characterize stellar, gas, and dark matter mass distributions for 17
nearby massive disk galaxies from the PHANGS sample. This allows
us to compute the gravitational potential that vertically
confines the interstellar gas and determines its equilibrium
scale height and weight. We first combine dynamical mass
constraints from existing CO and H I rotation curves, together
with stellar and gas mass estimates from near-infrared, CO, and
H I data. These estimates incorporate current best practices in
modeling stellar mass-to-light ratios and CO-to-H$_{2}$
conversion factor variations. Then, we fit joint
stellar─gas─dark matter mass models to the rotation curves,
adopting the classic maximal disk assumption to account for
remaining zero-point uncertainties on the stellar mass-to-light
ratio. After obtaining three-component radial mass profiles, we
calculate the vertical equilibrium gas scale height and
interstellar medium (ISM) weight in the combined gravitational
potential. We find the gas scale height H$_{gas}$ increases from
{\ensuremath{\lesssim}}100 pc in the inner disks to >500 pc at
large radii, consistent with observations of our Galaxy and
other edge-on galaxies. The gas weight is dominated by stellar
gravity at small radii, but the gas and dark matter gravity
often become important beyond 3─6 times the stellar disk radial
scale length. Both our gas scale height and weight estimates are
dependent on the treatment of stellar disk scale height
H$_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$, with H$_{gas}$ varying by 30\%─40\%
when H$_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ varies by a factor of 3. The
relationship between our refined ISM weight estimates and local
star formation surface density generally agrees with previous
observations and predictions from theory and simulations.}},

 abstract = {{ARKENSTONE is a new scheme that allows multiphase, stellar feedback-
driven winds to be included in coarse resolution cosmological
simulations. The evolution of galactic winds and their
subsequent impact on the circumgalactic medium are altered by
exchanges of mass, energy, momentum, and metals between their
component phases. These exchanges are governed by complex,
small-scale physical processes that cannot be resolved in
cosmological simulations. In this second presentation paper, we
describe ARKENSTONE's novel cloud particle approach for
modelling unresolvable cool clouds entrained in hot, fast winds.
This general framework allows models of the cloud-wind
interaction, derived from state-of-the-art high-resolution
simulations, to be applied in a large-scale context. In this
work, we adopt a cloud evolution model that captures
simultaneous cloud mass loss to and gain from the ambient hot
phase via turbulent mixing and radiative cooling, respectively.
We demonstrate the scheme using non-cosmological idealized
simulations of a galaxy with a realistic circumgalactic medium
component, using the AREPO code. We show that the ability of a
high-specific energy wind component to perform preventative
feedback may be limited by heavy loading of cool clouds coupled
into it. We demonstrate that the diverging evolution of clouds
of initially differing masses leads to a complex velocity field
for the cool phase and a cloud mass function that varies both
spatially and temporally in a non-trivial manner. These latter
two phenomena can manifest in the simulation because of our
choice of a Lagrangian discretization of the cloud population,
in contrast to other proposed schemes.}},

photoionizes hydrogen. Considering two models, representing
solar neighborhood and inner-galaxy conditions, we characterize

four approximate models for the FUV to simulated values to
evaluate alternatives when full ART is infeasible. By convolving
FUV radiation with density, we produce mock maps of dust
emission. We introduce a method to calibrate mid-IR
observations, for example from JWST, to obtain high-resolution
gas surface density maps. We then consider the LyC radiation
field, finding most of the gas exposed to this radiation to be
in ionization─recombination equilibrium and to have a low

 abstract = {{Traditional star formation subgrid models implemented in cosmological
galaxy formation simulations, such as that of V. Springel \& L.
Hernquist (hereafter SH03), employ adjustable parameters to
satisfy constraints measured in the local Universe. In recent
years, however, theory and spatially resolved simulations of the
turbulent, multiphase, star-forming interstellar medium (ISM)
have begun to produce new first-principles models, which when
fully developed can replace traditional subgrid prescriptions.
This approach has advantages of being physically motivated and
predictive rather than empirically tuned, and allowing for
varying environmental conditions rather than being tied to
local-Universe conditions. As a prototype of this new approach,
by combining calibrations from the TIGRESS numerical framework
with the pressure-regulated feedback-modulated (PRFM) theory,
simple formulae can be obtained for both the gas depletion time
and an effective equation of state. Considering galaxies in
TNG50, we compare the ``native'' simulation outputs with
postprocessed predictions from PRFM. At TNG50 resolution, the
total midplane pressure is nearly equal to the total ISM weight,
indicating that galaxies in TNG50 are close to satisfying
vertical equilibrium. The measured gas scale height is also
close to theoretical equilibrium predictions. The slopes of the
effective equations of states are similar, but with effective
velocity dispersion normalization from SH03 slightly larger than
that from current TIGRESS simulations. Because of this and the
decrease in PRFM feedback yield at high pressure, the PRFM model
predicts shorter gas depletion times than the SH03 model at high
densities and redshift. Our results represent a first step
toward implementing new, numerically calibrated subgrid
algorithms in cosmological galaxy formation simulations.}},

hot bubble inside the forward shock slows expansion, leading to
eventual shock breakup. Understanding SNR evolution at this
stage is vital for predicting feedback in galaxies, since SNRs
are expected to deposit their energy and momentum into the
interstellar medium at the ends of their lives. A key prediction
of SNR evolutionary models is the formation at the onset of the
radiative stage of a cold, dense shell behind the forward shock.
However, searches for these shells via their neutral hydrogen
emission have had limited success. We instead introduce an
independent observational signal of shell formation arising from
the interaction between nonthermal particles accelerated by the
SNR forward shock (cosmic rays) and the dense shell. Using a
semi-analytic model of particle acceleration based on state-of-
the-art simulations coupled with a high-resolution hydrodynamic
model of SNR evolution, we predict the nonthermal emission that
arises from this interaction. We demonstrate that the onset of
the radiative stage leads to nonthermal signatures from radio to
gamma rays, including radio and gamma-ray brightening by nearly
2 orders of magnitude. Such a signature may be detectable with
current instruments, and will be resolvable with the next

sensitively with both weight and metallicity as
ϒth{\ensuremath{\propto}}W‑0.46Z'‑0.53, while the combined

{\ensuremath{\Sigma}}$_{SFR}$ at low metallicity is due mainly
to enhanced thermal feedback yield, resulting from reduced
attenuation of UV radiation. With the metallicity-dependent
calibrations we provide, PRFM theory can be used for a new
subgrid star formation prescription in cosmological simulations

 abstract = {{Bubbles driven by energy and mass injection from small scales are
ubiquitous in astrophysical fluid systems and essential to
feedback across multiple scales. In particular, O stars in young
clusters produce high-velocity winds that create hot bubbles in
the surrounding gas. We demonstrate that the dynamical evolution
of these bubbles is critically dependent upon the geometry of
their interfaces with their surroundings and the nature of heat
transport across these interfaces. These factors together
determine the amount of energy that can be lost from the
interior through cooling at the interface, which in turn
determines the ability of the bubble to do work on its
surroundings. We further demonstrate that the scales relevant to
physical dissipation across this interface are extremely
difficult to resolve in global numerical simulations of bubbles
for parameter values of interest. This means the dissipation
driving evolution of these bubbles in numerical simulations is
often of a numerical nature. We describe the physical and
numerical principles that determine the level of dissipation in
these simulations; we use this, along with a fractal model for
the geometry of the interfaces, to explain differences in
convergence behavior between hydrodynamical and
magnetohydrodynamical simulations presented here. We
additionally derive an expression for momentum as a function of
bubble radius expected when the relevant dissipative scales are

 abstract = {{We investigate the dynamical interaction between cosmic rays (CRs) and
the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) using numerical
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with a two-moment CR
solver and TIGRESS simulations of star-forming galactic disks.
We previously studied the transport of CRs within TIGRESS
outputs using a ``postprocessing'' approach, and we now assess
the effects of the MHD backreaction to CR pressure. We confirm
our previous conclusion that there are three quite different
regimes of CR transport in multiphase ISM gas, while also
finding that simulations with ``live MHD'' predict a smoother CR
pressure distribution. The CR pressure near the midplane is
comparable to other pressure components in the gas, but the
scale height of CRs is far larger. Next, with a goal of
understanding the role of CRs in driving galactic outflows, we
conduct a set of controlled simulations of the extraplanar
region above z = 500 pc, with imposed boundary conditions
flowing from the midplane into this region. We explore a range
of thermal and kinematic properties for the injected thermal
gas, encompassing both hot, fast-moving outflows, and cooler,
slower-moving outflows. The boundary conditions for CR energy
density and flux are scaled from the supernova rate in the
underlying TIGRESS model. Our simulations reveal that CRs
efficiently accelerate extraplanar material if the latter is
mostly warm/warm-hot gas, in which CRs stream at the Alfv{\'e}n
speed, and the effective sound speed increases as density
decreases. In contrast, CRs have very little effect on fast, hot
outflows where the Alfv{\'e}n speed is small, even when the
injected CR momentum flux exceeds the injected MHD momentum
flux.}},

 abstract = {{ARKENSTONE is a new model for multiphase, stellar feedback-driven
galactic winds designed for inclusion in coarse resolution

describe the features that allow ARKENSTONE to properly treat
high specific energy wind components and demonstrate them using
idealized non-cosmological simulations of a galaxy with a
realistic circumgalactic medium (CGM), using the AREPO code.
Hot, fast gas phases with low mass loadings are predicted to
dominate the energy content of multiphase outflows. In order to
treat the huge dynamic range of spatial scales involved in
cosmological galaxy formation at feasible computational expense,
cosmological volume simulations typically employ a Lagrangian
code or else use adaptive mesh refinement with a quasi-
Lagrangian refinement strategy. However, it is difficult to
inject a high specific energy wind in a Lagrangian scheme
without incurring artificial burstiness. Additionally, the low
densities inherent to this type of flow result in poor spatial
resolution. ARKENSTONE addresses these issues with a novel
scheme for coupling energy into the transition region between
the interstellar medium (ISM) and the CGM, while also providing
refinement at the base of the wind. Without our improvements, we
show that poor spatial resolution near the sonic point of a hot,
fast outflow leads to an underestimation of gas acceleration as
the wind propagates. We explore the different mechanisms by
which low and high specific energy winds can regulate the star
formation rate of galaxies. In future work, we will demonstrate
other aspects of the ARKENSTONE model.}},

such measurements remain scarce, as SNe are rare and often

around evolved massive stars that are soon to explode. These
provide a substantially larger sample of `explosion sites' (than
just historical SNe) in nearby galaxies that have high-
resolution atomic and molecular ISM maps from Jansky VLA and
ALMA. We demonstrate this technique in the well-resolved Local
Group spiral M33 by analyzing the 50 pc-scale projected ISM
densities around red supergiants (RSGs, 8-30 M$_{\odot}$ stars)
Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs, $>$30 M$_{\odot}$ stars), and supernova

We adopt the TIGRESS framework developed by Kim \& Ostriker to

as a typical case. The simulations use a new GPU-accelerated
version of the Athena++ AMR code, and they span more than six
orders of magnitude in radius, reaching scales similar to that
of the black hole horizon. The key physical ingredients are
radiative cooling and a phenomenological heating model. We find
that the accretion flow takes the form of multiphase gas at
radii less than about a kpc. The cold gas accretion includes two
dynamically distinct stages: the typical disk stage in which the
cold gas resides in a rotationally supported disk, and
relatively rare chaotic stages ({\ensuremath{\lesssim}}10\% of
the time) in which the cold gas inflows via chaotic streams.
Though cold gas accretion dominates the time-averaged accretion
rate at intermediate radii, accretion at the smallest radii is
dominated by hot virialized gas at most times. The accretion
rate scales with radius as $\dot{M}\propto {r}^{1/2}$ when hot
gas dominates, and we obtain $\dot{M}\simeq

hot gas accretion rate is suppressed relative to the Bondi rate
by $\sim {({r}_{{\rm{g}}}/{r}_{\mathrm{Bondi}})}^{1/2}$ . Our

in the ISM and efficient energy recovery by stellar feedback
lead to coregulation of SFRs and the ISM state. Realistic
approaches to this problem should solve for the dynamical
evolution of the ISM, including star formation and the input of
feedback energy self-consistently and accurately. Here, we
present the TIGRESS-NCR numerical framework, in which UV
radiation, supernovae, cooling and heating processes, and
gravitational collapse are modeled explicitly. We use an
adaptive ray-tracing method for UV radiation transfer from star
clusters represented by sink particles, accounting for
attenuation by dust and gas. We solve photon-driven chemical
equations to determine the abundances of hydrogen (time
dependent) and carbon/oxygen-bearing species (steady state),
which then set cooling and heating rates self-consistently.
Applying these methods, we present high-resolution
magnetohydrodynamics simulations of differentially rotating
local galactic disks representing typical conditions of nearby
star-forming galaxies. We analyze ISM properties and phase
distributions and show good agreement with existing
multiwavelength galactic observations. We measure midplane
pressure components (turbulent, thermal, and magnetic) and the
weight, demonstrating that vertical dynamical equilibrium holds.
We quantify the ratios of pressure components to the SFR surface

 abstract = {{We present an efficient heating/cooling method coupled with chemistry
and UV radiative transfer that can be applied to numerical
simulations of the interstellar medium (ISM). We follow the
time-dependent evolution of hydrogen species (H$_{2}$, H,
H$^{+}$), assume carbon/oxygen species (C, C$^{+}$, CO, O, and
O$^{+}$) are in formation-destruction balance given the
nonsteady hydrogen abundances, and include essential
heating/cooling processes needed to capture the thermodynamics
of all ISM phases. UV radiation from discrete point sources and
the diffuse background is followed through adaptive ray tracing
and a six-ray approximation, respectively, allowing for H$_{2}$
self-shielding; cosmic-ray heating and ionization are also
included. To validate our methods and demonstrate their
application for a range of density, metallicity, and radiation
fields, we conduct a series of tests, including the equilibrium
curves of thermal pressure versus density, the chemical and
thermal structure in photodissociation regions, H I-to-H$_{2}$
transitions, and the expansion of H II regions and radiative
supernova remnants. Careful treatment of photochemistry and
cosmic-ray ionization is essential for many aspects of ISM
physics, including identifying the thermal pressure at which
cold and warm neutral phases coexist. We caution that many
current heating and cooling treatments used in galaxy formation
simulations do not reproduce the correct thermal pressure and
ionization fraction in the neutral ISM. Our new model is
implemented in the MHD code Athena and incorporated in the
TIGRESS simulation framework, for use in studying the star-
forming ISM in a wide range of environments.}},

answer the outstanding questions of the Universe's structure
formation. It will also provide transformative new observing
capabilities for every area of astrophysics, and to heliophysics

comprehensive look at the physics of galaxy formation, including
stellar and black-hole feedback and flows of baryonic matter
into and out of galaxies. These processes are best studied in
X-rays, and emission-line mapping is the pressing need in this
area. LEM will use a large microcalorimeter array/IFU, covering
a 30x30' field with 10'' angular resolution, to map the soft
X-ray line emission from objects that constitute galactic
ecosystems. These include supernova remnants, star-forming
regions, superbubbles, galactic outflows (such as the
Fermi/eROSITA bubbles in the Milky Way and their analogs in
other galaxies), the Circumgalactic Medium in the Milky Way and
other galaxies, and the Intergalactic Medium at the outskirts
and beyond the confines of galaxies and clusters. LEM's 1-2 eV
spectral resolution in the 0.2-2 keV band will make it possible
to disentangle the faintest emission lines in those objects from
the bright Milky Way foreground, providing groundbreaking
measurements of the physics of these plasmas, from temperatures,
densities, chemical composition to gas dynamics. While LEM's
main focus is on galaxy formation, it will provide
transformative capability for all classes of astrophysical
objects, from the Earth's magnetosphere, planets and comets to
the interstellar medium and X-ray binaries in nearby galaxies,
AGN, and cooling gas in galaxy clusters. In addition to pointed
observations, LEM will perform a shallow all-sky survey that
will dramatically expand the discovery space.}},

 abstract = {{In addition to occupying the extreme, diffuse tail of the dwarf galaxy
population, ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) are themselves a key
laboratory in which to study star formation in extreme low-
density environments. In the second paper of this series, we
compare the spatially resolved star formation activity of 22 H
I-selected UDGs and 21 ``normal'' dwarf galaxies within 120 Mpc
to predictions within the pressure-regulated, feedback-modulated
(PRFM) theory of star formation. To do so, we employ a joint
spectral energy distribution fitting method that allows us to
estimate star formation rate and stellar mass surface density
from UV-optical imaging. We find that the PRFM framework extends
successfully to the UDG regime-although the UDGs in our sample
show unusually low star formation rate surface densities given
their H I content, this low star formation efficiency can be
naturally explained by the diffuse structure of the UDGs. In
fact, when cast in the PRFM framework, the relationship between
midplane pressure and star formation in the UDG sample is in
good agreement not only with the ``normal'' dwarf reference
sample, but also with measurements from more massive galaxies.
Our results suggest that despite their low star formation
efficiencies, the H I-rich UDGs need not be forming stars in an
exotic manner. We also find that the UDGs are likely H$_{2}$
poor compared even to the overall dwarf population.}},

 abstract = {{The star formation rate (SFR) in galactic disks depends on both the
quantity of the available interstellar medium (ISM) gas and its
physical state. Conversely, the ISM's physical state depends on
the SFR, because the ``feedback'' energy and momentum injected
by recently formed massive stars is crucial to offsetting losses
from turbulent dissipation and radiative cooling. The ISM's
physical state also responds to the gravitational field that
confines it, with increased weight driving higher pressure. In a
quasi-steady state, it is expected that the mean total pressure
of different thermal phases will match each other, that the
component pressures and total pressure will satisfy thermal and
dynamical equilibrium requirements, and that the SFR will adjust
as needed to provide the requisite stellar radiation and
supernova feedback. The pressure-regulated, feedback-modulated
(PRFM) theory of the star-forming ISM formalizes these ideas,
leading to a prediction that the SFR per unit area,
{\ensuremath{\Sigma}}$_{SFR}$, will scale nearly linearly with
ISM weight ${ \mathcal W }$ . In terms of the large-scale gas
surface density {\ensuremath{\Sigma}}$_{gas}$, stellar plus dark

medium (ISM) quickly, playing a vital role in galaxy evolution.
Previous RPS studies have treated the ISM as single-phase or
lack the resolution and physical processes to properly capture
the full multiphase ISM. To improve this simplification, we
introduce an inflowing, hot intracluster medium (ICM) into a
self-consistently modeled ISM in a local patch of star-forming
galactic disks using the TIGRESS framework. Our simulations
reveal that the workings of RPS are not only direct acceleration
of the ISM by ICM ram pressure but also mixing-driven momentum
transfer involving significant phase transition and radiative
cooling. The hot ICM passes through the low-density channels of
the porous, multiphase ISM; shreds the cool ISM; and creates
mixing layers. The ICM momentum is transferred through the
mixing layers while populating the intermediate-temperature gas
and radiating thermal energy away. The mixed gas extends beyond
galactic disks and forms stripped tails that cool back unless
the ICM fluxes are large enough to prevent cooling until they
escape the simulation domain. The mixing-driven momentum
transfer predicts that the more ICM mixes in, the faster the ISM
moves, resulting in the anticorrelation of outflow velocity and
gas metallicity of the stripped ISM. The compression of the ISM
disks due to the ICM ram pressure enhances star formation rates
up to 50\% compared to the model without ICM. With the ICM ram
pressure higher than the disk anchoring pressure, star formation
is quenched within \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde100 Myr.}},

dispersion, epicyclic frequency, and dark-matter volumetric
density representative of each region in the context of their
star formation activity and environment (radial galactocentric
location). By examining the star formation rate (SFR) weighted
distributions of these properties, we show that stars primarily
form in two distinct environmental regimes, which are brought
about by an underlying bicomponent radial SFR profile in
galaxies. We examine how the relative prominence of these
regimes depends on galaxy mass and cosmic time. We also compare
our findings with those from integral field spectroscopy
observations and find similarities as well as departures.
Further, using dimensionality reduction, we characterize the
aforementioned hyperspace to reveal a high degree of
multicollinearity in relationships among ISM properties that
drive the distribution of star formation at kiloparsec scales.
Based on this, we show that a reduced 3D representation
underpinned by a multivariate radius relationship is sufficient
to capture most of the variance in the original 8D space.}},

rings varies considerably with time and is sometimes asymmetric
rather than being uniform across a ring. To understand what
controls temporal and spatial distributions of ring star
formation, we run semiglobal, hydrodynamic simulations of
nuclear rings subject to time-varying and/or asymmetric mass
inflow rates. These controlled variations in the inflow lead to
variations in the star formation, while the ring orbital period
(18 Myr) and radius (600 pc) remain approximately constant. We
find that both the mass inflow rate and supernova feedback
affect the ring SFR. An oscillating inflow rate with period

20 causes large-amplitude (a factor of {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}5),
quasi-periodic variations of the SFR when

interstellar medium (ISM) weight and midplane pressure track
each other closely, establishing an instantaneous vertical
equilibrium. The measured time-varying depletion time is
consistent with the prediction from self-regulation theory
provided the time delay between star formation and supernova
feedback is taken into account. The supernova feedback is
responsible only for small-amplitude (a factor of

mass 'loading factor' drops below one in massive galaxies. Most
of the mass is carried by the hot phase (>{}10$^{5}$ K) in

factors from the ISM are of order unity in dwarfs and
significantly lower in more massive haloes. Hot outflows have
2-5 {\texttimes} higher specific energy than needed to escape
from the gravitational potential of dwarf haloes; indeed, in
dwarfs, the mass, momentum, and metal outflow rates increase
with radius whereas energy is roughly conserved, indicating
swept up halo gas. Burst-averaged mass loading factors tend to
be larger during more powerful star formation episodes and when

 abstract = {{Stellar winds contain enough energy to easily disrupt the parent cloud
surrounding a nascent star cluster, and for this reason they
have long been considered candidates for regulating star
formation. However, direct observations suggest most wind power
is lost, and Lancaster et al. recently proposed that this is due
to efficient mixing and cooling processes. Here we simulate star
formation with wind feedback in turbulent, self-gravitating
clouds, extending our previous work. Our simulations cover
clouds with an initial surface density of {}10$^{2}$-{}10$^{4}$
M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ pc$^{-2}$ and show that star
formation and residual gas dispersal are complete within two to
eight initial cloud freefall times. The ``efficiently cooled''
model for stellar wind bubble evolution predicts that enough
energy is lost for the bubbles to become momentum-driven; we
find that this is satisfied in our simulations. We also find
that wind energy losses from turbulent, radiative mixing layers
dominate losses by ``cloud leakage'' over the timescales
relevant for star formation. We show that the net star formation
efficiency (SFE) in our simulations can be explained by theories
that apply wind momentum to disperse cloud gas, allowing for
highly inhomogeneous internal cloud structure. For very dense
clouds, the SFE is similar to those observed in extreme star-
forming environments. Finally, we find that, while self-
pollution by wind material is insignificant in cloud conditions
with moderate density (only {\ensuremath{\lesssim}}10$^{-4}$ of
the stellar mass originated in winds), our simulations with
conditions more typical of a super star cluster have star
particles that form with as much as 1\% of their mass in wind
material.}},

 abstract = {{In a companion paper, we develop a theory for the evolution of stellar
wind-driven bubbles in dense, turbulent clouds. This theory
proposes that turbulent mixing at a fractal bubble/shell
interface leads to highly efficient cooling, in which the vast
majority of the input wind energy is radiated away. This energy
loss renders the majority of the bubble evolution momentum
driven rather than energy driven, with expansion velocities and
pressures orders of magnitude lower than in the classical Weaver
et al. solution. In this paper, we validate our theory with
three-dimensional, hydrodynamic simulations. We show that
extreme cooling is not only possible, but is generic to star
formation in turbulent clouds over more than three orders of
magnitude in density. We quantify the few free parameters in our
theory, and show that the momentum exceeds the wind input rate
by only a factor ${\alpha }_{p}\sim 1.2\mbox{--}4$ . We verify
that the bubble/cloud interface is a fractal with dimension
$\sim 2.5\mbox{--}2.7$ . The measured turbulent amplitude (
${v}_{t}\sim 200\mbox{--}400\,\ \mathrm{km}\,\ {{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$
) in the hot gas near the interface is shown to be consistent
with theoretical requirements for turbulent diffusion to
efficiently mix and radiate away most of the wind energy. The
fraction of energy remaining after cooling is only
$1-{\rm{\Theta }}\sim 0.1\mbox{--}0.01$ , decreasing with time,
explaining observations that indicate low hot-gas content and
weak dynamical effects of stellar winds.}},

Despite variations in ${X}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ , the empirically

simulations of the interstellar medium (ISM) in galactic disks

varying metallicity, far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation, and
cosmic-ray ionization rate (CRIR). With the TIGRESS simulation
framework we model the three-phase ISM with self-consistent star
formation and feedback, and post-process outputs with chemistry
and radiation transfer to generate synthetic CO (1-0) and (2-1)
maps. Our models reproduce the observed CO excitation
temperatures, line widths, and line ratios in nearby disk
galaxies. ${X}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ decreases with increasing
metallicity, with a power-law slope of -0.8 for the (1-0) line

increasing excitation temperature and then increases when the

 abstract = {{Resolving the phase structure of neutral hydrogen (H I) is crucial for
understanding the life cycle of the interstellar medium (ISM).
However, accurate measurements of H I temperature and density
are limited by the availability of background continuum sources
for measuring H I absorption. Here we test the use of deep
learning for extracting H I properties over large areas without
optical depth information. We train a 1D convolutional neural
network using synthetic observations of 3D numerical simulations
of the ISM to predict the fraction ( ${f}_{\mathrm{CNM}}$ ) of
cold neutral medium (CNM) and the correction to the optically
thin H I column density for optical depth ( ${{ \mathcal R
}}_{{\rm{H}}{\rm\small{I}}}$ ) from 21 cm emission alone. We
restrict our analysis to high Galactic latitudes ( $| b|
30^\circ $ ), where the complexity of spectral line profiles is
minimized. We verify that the network accurately predicts
${f}_{\mathrm{CNM}}$ and ${{ \mathcal R
}}_{{\rm{H}}{\rm\small{I}}}$ by comparing the results with
direct constraints from 21 cm absorption. By applying the
network to the GALFA-H I survey, we generate large-area maps of
${f}_{\mathrm{CNM}}$ and ${{ \mathcal R
}}_{{\rm{H}}{\rm\small{I}}}$ . Although the overall contribution
to the total H I column of CNM-rich structures is small
({\ensuremath{\sim}}5\%), we find that these structures are
ubiquitous. Our results are consistent with the picture that
small-scale structures observed in 21 cm emission aligned with
the magnetic field are dominated by CNM. Finally, we demonstrate
that the observed correlation between H I column density and
dust reddening ( $E(B-V)$ ) declines with increasing ${{
\mathcal R }}_{{\rm{H}}{\rm\small{I}}}$ , indicating that future
efforts to quantify foreground Galactic $E(B-V)$ using H I, even
at high latitudes, should increase fidelity by accounting for H
I phase structure.}},

global correlation with the star formation rate (SFR) over time.
The gravity-based method identifies bound objects, which have
masses $M\sim {10}^{3}\mbox{--}{10}^{4}\,{M}_{\odot }$ at
densities ${n}_{{\rm{H}}}\sim 100\,{\mathrm{cm}}^{-3}$ , and
virial parameters {\ensuremath{\alpha}}$_{v}$
{\ensuremath{\sim}} 0.5-5. For clouds defined by a density
threshold ${n}_{{\rm{H}},\min }$ , the average virial parameter
decreases, and the fraction of material that is genuinely bound
increases, with increasing ${n}_{{\rm{H}},\min }$ .
Surprisingly, clouds defined by density thresholds can be
unbound even when {\ensuremath{\alpha}}$_{v}$ < 2, and high-mass
clouds ( ${10}^{4}\mbox{--}{10}^{6}\,{M}_{\odot }$ ) are
generally unbound. This suggests that the traditional
{\ensuremath{\alpha}}$_{v}$ is at best an approximate measure of
boundedness in the ISM. All clouds have internal turbulent
motions increasing with size as $\sigma \sim
1\,\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}{(R/\mathrm{pc})}^{1/2}$ ,
similar to observed relations. Bound structures comprise a small
fraction of the total simulation mass and have a star formation

density threshold. A temporal correlation analysis between
$\mathrm{SFR}(t)$ and aggregate mass $M({n}_{{\rm{H}},\min };t)$
at varying ${n}_{{\rm{H}},\min }$ shows that time delays to star
formation are ${t}_{\mathrm{delay}}\sim

between $\mathrm{SFR}(t)$ and $M({n}_{{\rm{H}},\min };t)$
systematically tightens at higher ${n}_{{\rm{H}},\min }$ .
Considering moderate-density gas, selecting against high virial
parameter clouds improves correlation with the SFR, consistent
with previous work. Even at high ${n}_{{\rm{H}},\min }$ , the
temporal dispersion in $(\mathrm{SFR}-{\varepsilon

more than 90\% of star formation takes place in spiral arms, but
the global star formation rate (SFR) in models with spiral arms

spurs/feathers downstream from arms in both magnetized and
unmagnetized models. These spurs/feathers are short lived and
have magnetic fields parallel to their length, in contrast to
the longer-lived features with perpendicular magnetic fields

ionized gas seen in both the Milky Way and other disk galaxies.
For a theoretical investigation of the warm ionized medium

the interstellar medium (ISM) and clusters are modeled self-
consistently. To this end, we employ a solar neighborhood model
of Three-phase Interstellar Medium in Galaxies Resolving
Evolution with Star Formation and Supernova Feedback (TIGRESS),
a magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the multiphase, star-forming
ISM, and post-process the simulation with an adaptive ray
tracing method to transfer UV radiation from star clusters. We
find that the WIM volume filling factor is highly variable, and
sensitive to the rate of ionizing photon production and ISM
structure. The mean WIM volume filling factor rises to
{\ensuremath{\sim}}0.15 at $| z| \sim 1\,\,\mathrm{kpc}$ .
Approximately half of ionizing photons are absorbed by gas and
half by dust; the cumulative ionizing photon escape fraction is
1.1\%. Our time-averaged synthetic ${\rm{H}}\alpha $ line
profile matches Wisconsin ${\rm{H}}\alpha $ Mapper observations
on the redshifted (outflowing) side, but has insufficient
intensity on the blueshifted side. Our simulation matches the
Dickey-Lockman neutral density profile well, but only a small
fraction of snapshots have high-altitude WIM density consistent
with Reynolds Layer estimates. We compute a clumping correction
factor ${{ \mathcal C }}_{{n}_{{\rm{e}}}}\equiv \langle
{n}_{{\rm{e}}}\rangle /\langle {n}_{{\rm{e}}}^{2}{\rangle

multiphase in nature. Observations and simulations indicate that
the material within several kiloparsecs of galactic disk
midplanes consists of warm clouds embedded within a hot wind. A
theoretical understanding of the outflow phenomenon, including
both winds and fountain flows, requires study of the
interactions among thermal phases. We develop a method to
quantify these interactions via measurements of mass, momentum,
and energy flux exchanges using temporally and spatially
averaged quantities and conservation laws. We apply this method
to a star-forming interstellar medium simulation based on the
TIGRESS framework, for solar neighborhood conditions. To
evaluate the extent of interactions among the phases, we examine
the validity of the ``ballistic model,'' which predicts the
trajectories of the warm phase (5050 K < T < 2 {\texttimes}
{}10$^{4}$ K) treated as non-interacting clouds. This model is
successful at intermediate vertical velocities (
$50\,\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}\lesssim | {V}_{z}| \lesssim
100\,\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ ), but at higher velocities,
we observe an excess in simulated warm outflow compared to the
ballistic model. This discrepancy cannot be fully accounted for
by cooling of high-velocity, intermediate-temperature (2
{\texttimes} {}10$^{4}$ K < T < 5 {\texttimes} {}10$^{5}$ K)
gas. We examine the fluxes of mass, momentum, and energy and
conclude that the warm phase gains mass via cooling of the
intermediate phase and momentum from the hot (T > 5 {\texttimes}
{}10$^{5}$ K) phase. The large energy flux from the hot outflow,
transferred to the warm and intermediate phases, is quickly
radiated away. A simple interaction model implies an effective
warm cloud size in the fountain flow of a few 100 pc, showing
that warm-hot flux exchange mainly involves a few large clouds
rather than many small ones.}},

thermal conduction and cooling in the interface between the hot
bubble interior and cooled shell. Our simulations employ an
effective diffusivity to account for turbulent mixing from non-
linear instabilities that are not captured in 1D. The conductive
heat flux into the shell is balanced by a combination of cooling
in the interface and evaporation of shell gas into the bubble
interior. This evaporation increases the density, and decreases
the temperature, of the SB interior by more than an order of
magnitude relative to simulations without conduction. However,
most of the energy conducted into the interface is immediately
lost to cooling, reducing the evaporative mass flux required to
balance conduction. As a result, the evaporation rate is
typically a factor of {\ensuremath{\sim}}3-30 lower than
predicted by the classical similarity solution of (Weaver et al.
1977), which neglects cooling. Blast waves from the first
{\ensuremath{\sim}}30 SNe remain supersonic in the SB interior
because reduced evaporation from the interface lowers the mass
they sweep up in the hot interior. Updating the Weaver solution
to include cooling, we construct a new analytic model to predict
the cooling rate, evaporation rate, and temporal evolution of

accretion of gas that leads to star formation in clusters; (2)
the explosions of supernovae (SNe), both near their progenitor
birth sites and from runaway OB stars, with time delays relative

explicit evolution of SN remnants prior to the onset of cooling,

 abstract = {{We analyze synthetic neutral hydrogen (H I) absorption and emission
spectral lines from a high-resolution, three-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulation to quantify how well observational
methods recover the physical properties of interstellar gas. We
present a new method for uniformly decomposing H I spectral
lines and estimating the properties of associated gas using the
Autonomous Gaussian Decomposition (AGD) algorithm. We find that
H I spectral lines recover physical structures in the simulation
with excellent completeness at high Galactic latitude, and this
completeness declines with decreasing latitude due to strong
velocity-blending of spectral lines. The temperature and column
density inferred from our decomposition and radiative transfer
method agree with the simulated values within a factor of < 2
for the majority of gas structures. We next compare synthetic
spectra with observations from the 21-SPONGE survey at the Karl
G. Jansky Very Large Array using AGD. We find more components
per line of sight in 21-SPONGE than in synthetic spectra, which
reflects insufficient simulated gas scale heights and the
limitations of local box simulations. In addition, we find a
significant population of low-optical depth, broad absorption
components in the synthetic data which are not seen in
21-SPONGE. This population is not obvious in integrated or per-
channel diagnostics, and reflects the benefit of studying
velocity-resolved components. The discrepant components
correspond to the highest spin temperatures (1000< \{T\}$_{s}$<
4000 \{\{K\}\}), which are not seen in 21-SPONGE despite
sufficient observational sensitivity. We demonstrate that our
analysis method is a powerful tool for diagnosing neutral
interstellar medium conditions, and future work is needed to
improve observational statistics and implementation of simulated

form within a galaxy, we post-process a series of three-

In performing these simulations, we vary a number of parameters,

the sensitivity of our results to these variations. Self-
shielding permits significant molecular hydrogen (H$_{2}$)

attenuates the far-ultraviolet background. We additionally
compare these ray-tracing-based solutions to photochemistry with
complementary models where photoshielding is accounted for with
locally computed prescriptions. With some exceptions, these
local models for the radiative shielding length perform
reasonably well at reproducing the distribution and amount of

 abstract = {{Recent hydrodynamic (HD) simulations have shown that galactic disks
evolve to reach well-defined statistical equilibrium states. The
star formation rate (SFR) self-regulates until energy injection
by star formation feedback balances dissipation and cooling in
the interstellar medium (ISM), and provides vertical pressure
support to balance gravity. In this paper, we extend our
previous models to allow for a range of initial magnetic field
strengths and configurations, utilizing three-dimensional,
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. We show that a quasi-
steady equilibrium state is established as rapidly for MHD as
for HD models unless the initial magnetic field is very strong
or very weak, which requires more time to reach saturation.
Remarkably, models with initial magnetic energy varying by two
orders of magnitude approach the same asymptotic state. In the
fully saturated state of the fiducial model, the integrated
energy proportions E$_{turb}$:E$_{th}$:{\ensuremath{\delta}}
E$_{mag}$:\textbackslashbarE$_{mag}$ are 0.35:0.39:0.15:0.11,

0.49:0.18:0.18:0.15. Vertical profiles of total effective

region in a galaxy based on its observed gas and stellar surface
densities and velocity dispersions. As the ISM weight (or

their environments, with the former regulating multiphase
thermal structure and the latter regulating turbulence and star
formation rates in the interstellar medium (ISM). However,
systematic studies quantifying the impact of SNe in realistic
inhomogeneous ISM conditions have been lacking. Using three-
dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the
dependence of radial momentum injection on both physical
conditions (considering a range of mean density n$_{0}$ =
0.1-100 cm$^{-3}$) and numerical parameters. Our inhomogeneous
simulations adopt two-phase background states that result from
thermal instability in atomic gas. Although the supernova
remnant (SNR) morphology becomes highly complex for
inhomogeneous backgrounds, the radial momentum injection is
remarkably insensitive to environmental details. For our two-
phase simulations, the final momentum produced by a single SN is
given by 2.8{\texttimes}{}10$^{5}$ M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ km
s$^{-1}$ n$_{0}$$^{-0.17}$. This is only 5\% less than the
momentum injection for a homogeneous environment with the same
mean density, and only 30\% greater than the momentum at the
time of shell formation. The maximum mass in hot gas is also
quite insensitive to environmental inhomogeneity. Strong
magnetic fields alter the hot gas mass at very late times, but
the momentum injection remains the same. Initial experiments
with multiple spatially correlated SNe show a momentum per event
nearly as large as single-SN cases. We also present a full
numerical parameter study to assess convergence requirements.
For convergence in the momentum and other quantities, we find
that the numerical resolution {\ensuremath{\Delta}} and the
initial size of the SNR r$_{init}$ must satisfy

with both warm and cold phases. The range of star formation
surface densities and midplane thermal pressures is
{\ensuremath{\Sigma}}$_{SFR}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 10$^{-4}$ to
10$^{-2}$ M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ kpc$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ and P
$_{th}$/k $_{B}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} {}10$^{2}$ to {}10$^{4}$
cm$^{-3}$ K. In agreement with observations, turbulent velocity
dispersions are \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde7 km s$^{-1}$
and the ratio of the total (effective) to thermal pressure is
P$_{tot}$/P$_{th}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 4-5, across this whole
range (provided shielding is similar to the solar neighborhood).
We show that {\ensuremath{\Sigma}}$_{SFR}$ is not well
correlated with {\ensuremath{\Sigma}} alone, but rather with
{\ensuremath{\Sigma}} {\ensuremath{\rho}}$_{sd}$$^{1/2}$,
because the vertical gravity from stars and dark matter
dominates in outer disks. We also find that
{\ensuremath{\Sigma}}$_{SFR}$ has a strong, nearly linear
correlation with P$_{tot}$, which itself is within
\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde13\% of the dynamical
equilibrium estimate P$_{tot, DE}$. The quantitative
relationships we find between \&Sigma$_{SFR}$ and the turbulent
and thermal pressures show that star formation is highly
efficient for energy and momentum production, in contrast to the
low efficiency of mass consumption. Star formation rates adjust
until the ISM's energy and momentum losses are replenished by
feedback within a dynamical time.}},

 abstract = {{Galactic spiral shocks are dominant morphological features and believed
to be responsible for substructure formation within spiral arms
in disk galaxies. They can also contribute a substantial amount
of kinetic energy to the interstellar gas by tapping the
(differential) rotational motion. We use numerical hydrodynamic
simulations to investigate dynamics and structure of spiral
shocks with thermal instability (TI) in vertically stratified
galactic disks, focusing on environmental conditions (of heating
and the galactic potential) similar to the Solar neighborhood.
We initially consider an isothermal disk in vertical hydrostatic
equilibrium and let it evolve subject to interstellar cooling
and heating as well as a stellar spiral potential. Due to TI, a
disk with surface density {\ensuremath{\Sigma}}$_{0}$ >= 6.7 M
$_{sun}$ pc$^{-2}$ rapidly turns to a thin dense slab near the
midplane sandwiched between layers of rarefied gas. The imposed
spiral potential leads to a vertically curved shock that
exhibits strong flapping motions in the plane perpendicular to
the arm. The overall flow structure at saturation is comprised
of the arm, postshock expansion zone, and interarm regions that
occupy typically 10\%, 20\%, and 70\% of the arm-to-arm
distance, in which the gas resides for 15\%, 30\%, and 55\% of
the arm-to-arm crossing time, respectively. The flows are
characterized by transitions from rarefied to dense phases at
the shock and from dense to rarefied phases in the postshock
expansion zone, although gas with too-large postshock-density
does not undergo this return phase transition, instead forming
dense condensations. If self-gravity is omitted, the shock
flapping drives random motions in the gas, but only up to
\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde2-3 km s$^{-1}$ in the in-plane
direction and less than 2 km s$^{-1}$ in the vertical direction.
Time-averaged shock profiles show that the spiral arms in
stratified disks are broader and less dense compared to those in
unstratified models, and that the vertical density distribution
is overall consistent with local effective hydrostatic
equilibrium. Inclusion of self-gravity increases the dense gas
fraction by a factor of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde2 and
raises the in-plane velocity dispersion to
\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde5-7 km s$^{-1}$. When the disks
are massive enough, with {\ensuremath{\Sigma}}$_{0}$ >= 5 M
$_{sun}$ pc$^{-2}$, self-gravity promotes formation of bound
clouds that repeatedly collide with each other in the arm and
break up in the postshock expansion zone.}},

 abstract = {{Using one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations including interstellar
heating, cooling, and thermal conduction, we investigate
nonlinear evolution of gas flow across galactic spiral arms. We
model the gas as a non-self-gravitating, unmagnetized fluid and
follow its interaction with a stellar spiral potential in a
local frame comoving with the stellar pattern. Initially uniform
gas with density n$_{0}$ in the range 0.5 cm $^{-3}$ <= n$_{0}$
<= 10 cm $^{-3}$ rapidly separates into warm and cold phases as
a result of thermal instability (TI) and also forms a quasi-
steady shock that prompts phase transitions. After saturation,
the flow follows a recurring cycle: warm and cold phases in the
interarm region are shocked and immediately cool to become a
denser cold medium in the arm; postshock expansion reduces the
mean density to the unstable regime in the transition zone and
TI subsequently mediates evolution back into warm and cold
interarm phases. For our standard model with n$_{0}$ = 2 cm
$^{-3}$, the gas resides in the dense arm, thermally unstable
transition zone, and interarm region for 14\%, 22\%, and 64\% of
the arm-to-arm crossing time, respectively. These regions occupy
1\%, 16\%, and 83\% of the arm-to-arm distance, respectively.
Gas at intermediate temperatures (i.e., neither warm stable nor
cold states) represents
\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde25\%-30\% of the total mass,
similar to the fractions estimated from H I observations (larger
interarm distances could reduce this mass fraction, whereas
other physical processes associated with star formation could
increase it). Despite transient features and multiphase
structure, the time-averaged shock profiles can be matched to
that of a diffusive isothermal medium with temperature 1000 K
(which is < T$_{warm}$) and a ``particle'' mean free path of
l$_{0}$ = 100 pc . Finally, we quantify numerical conductivity
associated with translational motion of phase-separated gas on
the grid and show that convergence of numerical results requires
the numerical conductivity to be comparable to or smaller than
the physical conductivity.}},

 abstract = {{Spiral shocks are potentially a major source of turbulence in the
interstellar medium. To address this problem quantitatively, we
use numerical simulations to investigate gas flow across spiral
arms in vertically stratified, self-gravitating, magnetized
models of galactic disks. Our models are isothermal, quasi-
axisymmetric, and local in the quasi-radial direction while
global in the vertical direction. We find that a stellar spiral
potential perturbation promptly induces a spiral shock in the
gas flow. For vertically stratified gas disks, the shock front
in the radial-vertical plane is in general curved, and never
achieves a steady state. This behavior is in sharp contrast to
spiral shocks in two-dimensional (thin) disks, which are
generally stationary. The nonsteady motions in our models
include large-amplitude quasi-radial flapping of the shock
front. This flapping feeds random gas motions on the scale of
the vertical disk thickness, which then cascades to smaller
scales. The induced gas velocity dispersion in quasi-steady
state exceeds the sonic value for a range of shock strengths,
suggesting that spiral shocks are indeed an important generator
of turbulence in disk galaxies.}},
