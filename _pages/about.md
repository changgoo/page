Welcome! I'm a research scholar in the department of Astrophysical Sciences at Princeton University.

My research is driven by the premise that robust synthesis must be built from first principles. Rather than relying on phenomenological prescriptions, I develop physical understanding of individual processes using theory and controlled simulations.
I then implement and validate the corresponding numerical methods, and synthesize these elements into comprehensive frameworks where emergent behavior can be interpreted physically. Finally, I connect simulation results from these frameworks to observations through synthetic diagnostics, enabling continuous testing and refinement against real data.

Over the past decade I have built and validated the <a href="https://changgoo.github.io/tigress-web/index.html">TIGRESS</a> family of simulation frameworks, using them to explain how star formation self-regulates, how feedback launches multiphase outflows, and how turbulence and magnetic fields shape observable diagnostics.
